        <p class="aboutparagraph">Hi! I am Juliana Fernandez and welcome to my website.
           Iâ€™m currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer and Electronic Engineering
           Technology at the University of Hartford and will graduate in May of 2022 as a first-generation
            student. I am looking for my first full/internship profession in the electronic engineering field for 2022.</p>

          <p class="aboutparagraph1">I enjoy reverse engineering and understanding how a product is created along with the components it brings.
             I love to create and troubleshoot circuitry and brainstorm on how the electronic
             components can come together and interconnect in a circuit. Aside from circuitry, I also enjoy
              designing or drawing the schematic for the circuits. Five years from now I see myself working for Apple.Inc as a Circuit Physical Design Engineer.
          </p>
